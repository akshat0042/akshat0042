I am an MSCIT student with a strong interest in **backend systems, AI/ML and full-stack web development**.  
Currently, I’m diving deep into **Java Spring Boot**. I enjoy solving problems, building impactful projects, 
and learning new technologies that push my creativity forward.  

💻 I’ve worked on projects ranging from crop yield prediction with ML to full-stack platforms like a YouTube clone and a corporate wellness app.  

📚 I’m currently learning ...  
- Spring Boot (Advanced)  
- Modular Monolithic systems & System Design  
- AI/ML applications in real-world projects  

🚀 I’m open to collaborating on exciting development projects.  
✔ Always happy to discuss Java, AI/ML, and web development topics!  

Outside of tech, I love 🎮 video games, 🎵 exploring music, and 🏋 staying active.
